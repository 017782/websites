# Installation

Enhance module requires your device to install Magisk first since only Magisk can provide reliable boot script.

Magisk is a powerful tool that provides not only root but the ability to modify the system without actually change system files and more.

You can learn more about Magisk from [GitHub](https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk).

## Before you install

1. Make sure you know how to delete the module when you are unable to enter the system
2. Just in case, please backup your whole device data first

## Version corresponding

**Warning: You must use correct version of module, otherwise functions may not work properly, or the worst device can't boot.**
