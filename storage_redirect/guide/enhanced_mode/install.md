# Installation

We temporarily only provide [Magisk](https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk) modules, beacuse only Magisk can provide reliable boot script.

## Before you install

1. Make sure you know how to delete the module when you are unable to enter the system
2. Just in case, please backup your whole device data first

## Version corresponding

**Warning: You must use correct version of module, otherwise functions may not work properly, or the worst device can't boot.**
