# Installation

Enhance module requires your device to install Magisk first since only Magisk can provide reliable boot script.

Magisk is a powerful tool that provides not only root but the ability to modify the system without actually change system files and more.

You can learn more about Magisk from [GitHub](https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk).

## Before you install

1. Make sure you know how to delete the module when you are unable to enter the system
2. Just in case, please backup your whole device data first

## Download

Download and install **Riru (Riru - Core)** and **Riru - Storage Redirect** from **Magisk Manager**. Note, please search "Riru" rather than full name in Magisk Manager.

The latest version may not be uploaded to Magisk immediately. You can download [Riru](https://github.com/RikkaApps/Riru/releases) and [module](https://github.com/RikkaApps/StorageRedirect-assets/releases/tag/assets) directly from GitHub release.
